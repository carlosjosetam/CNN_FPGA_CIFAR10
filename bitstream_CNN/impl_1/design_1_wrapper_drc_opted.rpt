DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_0 input cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning

DSP cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_0 input cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.

DPIP-1#3 Warning

DPIP-1#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_1 input cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_1/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#5 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_1 input cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_1/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_0 output cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_1 output cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_0 multiplier stage cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_1 multiplier stage cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	CAMERA_PCLK_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to V17
	CAMERA_PCLK_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) cannot be placed

enum_USE_DPORT_FALSE_enum_DREG_ADREG_0_connects_CED_CEAD_RSTD_GND  
cam/CNN_main_map/CNN_main_simple_core_inst/DSP48E1_0: DSP48E1 is not using the D port (USE_DPORT = FALSE). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0'.
